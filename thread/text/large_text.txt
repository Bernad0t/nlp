Parallel computing is a method of executing multiple operations simultaneously.
The main idea of parallelism lies in dividing a large task into several smaller subtasks,
which can be solved concurrently on different processor cores or computational nodes.

Multithreaded programming has become the standard in modern software development.
With the advent of multi-core processors, using threads allows for significantly faster data processing.
Each thread performs its portion of work, and then the results are combined into a unified whole.

Big data analysis requires efficient parallel processing algorithms.
Machine learning, natural language processing, scientific computing - all these fields
actively use parallel computing to accelerate work with large volumes of information.

The actor model represents a mathematical model of parallel computation.
In this model, each actor is a computational primitive that reacts to incoming messages.
Actors can create new actors, send messages, and change their behavior.

Distributed computing technologies enable the use of resources from multiple computers.
Hadoop, Spark, Kafka - examples of frameworks for big data processing.
These systems provide fault tolerance and scalability of computations.

Optimizing parallel algorithms requires understanding hardware architecture.
Cache memory, instruction pipelining, vector instructions - all these factors affect performance.
Developers must consider hardware specifics when designing parallel systems.
